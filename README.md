# Urban-Heat-Island 
This is a group project for the course AI Methods for Social Goods in Carnegie Mellon University with Michaela and Daniel. 
This project aims to provide an optimal heat mitigation strategy for local government using satellite imagery as input.
The techniques include semantic segmentation and linear optimization. 
For the semantic segmentation part, satellite imagery is an input and the semantic segmentation model will label the image into diferrent land use classes. The output would be the calssified labels.
For the linear optimization part, the input are the labels of land uses and the output are the optimal heat mitigation strategies.
This provides a low-cost solution for local government interested in lowering the effect of urban heat island and combat climate change.
